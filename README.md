# caterpie-graphic

Caterpie is a project I created for my computer graphics class. Inspired by Professor Perlin's "Polly's World", I re-created one of my favorite Pokemon (Caterpie) with a 3D Modeler package and manipulated the 3D goemetric shapes and matrices to create an interactive and expressive character with a personality. Press "L" to make Caterpie look around, "I" to express love, "S" to make him sad, "U" to make him flip upside down, and "R" to roatate him.

Platform: Web  Date: Spring 2016  Created With: JavaScript, HTML Canvas, 3D Modeler package
